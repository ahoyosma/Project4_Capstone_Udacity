## Installation
The code needs to install the libraries xgboost, yellowbrick and shap aside from the Anaconda distribution for Python.
## Project motivation
This project is a requirement of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree. Inspired by my business background, i wanted to use a public data set in order to build an effective credit score with a machine learning approach (traditionally based on logistic regression) and explore what insights we can extract from de model aiming to demonstrate that nowadays the machine learning is not a blackbox.
## File Descriptions
there is a Notebook with all the development aiming to build an effective credit score.
## Results
The findings of the code can be found in the following post:
